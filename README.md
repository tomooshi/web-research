# search-three

Web research skills for coding agents, built on three search engines that find things in different ways:

| Engine | How it retrieves | Good at | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Kagi** | keyword + quality re-ranking | precise lookups, `site:`/`filetype:`, news, X/Twitter, clean page extraction | $0.012/search, $0.004/page extract |
| **Exa** | neural embeddings | "find pages *like* this", conceptual queries, papers/companies/repos, cheap extraction | $0.007/search, $0.001/page ($10 free credit/month) |
| **Marginalia** | keyword, anti-SEO index | personal sites, forums, old web, topics buried under SEO spam | free (1000 queries/day) |

When two or three of these independently return the same URL, that page is very likely relevant. The coordinator skill is built around that signal.

## What's inside

```
skills/
├── web-research/        coordinator: when to use which engine, research recipes
│   └── scripts/
│       ├── meta-search.sh   parallel fan-out to 2–3 engines, merged + deduped, agreement flagged
│       ├── fetch-page.sh    URL → markdown, fallback ladder: exa → kagi → curl → playwright → camoufox → wayback
│       ├── doctor.sh        setup check (tools, keys, optional extras)

└── marginalia-search/   Marginalia search + custom filters
extensions/search-cost/  (pi only, optional) live cost footer + /search-cost command
```

Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` ([Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) format) and bash scripts. The agent reads the SKILL.md when a task matches and runs the scripts. The four folders need to stay next to each other, because `web-research` calls the engine scripts through `../<skill>/scripts/`.

## Install

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add tomooshi/search-three
/plugin install search-three@search-three
```

Restart Claude Code. The skills show up as `search-three:web-research`, `search-three:kagi-search`, and so on.

### pi

```bash
pi install git:github.com/tomooshi/search-three
```

This also loads the optional `search-cost` footer extension. To skip it, run `pi config` and disable the extension.

### Anything else (Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, or a plain skills folder)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomooshi/search-three.git
cd search-three
./install.sh claude          # or: pi | agents | codex | /path/to/your/skills
```

`install.sh` symlinks by default, so a later `git pull` updates the skills. Use `--copy` to copy the folders instead, and `--force` to replace skills that already use these names.

## Requirements

- `bash`, `curl`, `python3`. The engine scripts only use the Python standard library. Works on Linux and macOS; on Windows, use WSL or Git Bash.
- Optional extras for `fetch-page.sh`'s free fallback steps. Each missing extra disables one step and the ladder skips it:
  - `pip install beautifulsoup4` enables the curl / wayback steps and is also needed by the browser steps
  - `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium` renders JS-heavy pages
  - Camoufox, a Firefox build that resists bot detection, for pages that block normal headless browsers:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/camoufox
    ~/.venvs/camoufox/bin/pip install 'camoufox[geoip]' beautifulsoup4
    ~/.venvs/camoufox/bin/python -m camoufox fetch
    ```

If your system Python won't allow `pip install` (PEP 668), put the extras in a venv and set `FETCH_PYTHON=/path/to/venv/bin/python`.

## API keys

Each script checks an environment variable first, then a key file:

| Engine | Get a key | Env var | Key file |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kagi | https://kagi.com/api (needs a Kagi account with API credit) | `KAGI_API_KEY` | `~/.config/kagi/api_key` |
| Exa | https://dashboard.exa.ai (free $10/month credit) | `EXA_API_KEY` | `~/.config/exa/api_key` |
| Marginalia | free non-commercial key on request, see https://about.marginalia-search.com/article/api/ | `MARGINALIA_API_KEY` | `~/.config/marginalia/api_key` |

```bash
for e in kagi exa marginalia; do mkdir -p ~/.config/$e; done
printf '%s' 'KAGI_KEY'       > ~/.config/kagi/api_key
printf '%s' 'EXA_KEY'        > ~/.config/exa/api_key
printf '%s' 'MARGINALIA_KEY' > ~/.config/marginalia/api_key
chmod 600 ~/.config/{kagi,exa,marginalia}/api_key
```

### Keeping keys away from the agent (optional)

Key files and env vars are readable by any agent that can run these scripts. If you'd rather the agent never see the keys, run a local proxy that holds them and adds the auth header, then point the scripts at it and give them a dummy key:

```bash
export KAGI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8811/api/v1      KAGI_API_KEY=dummy
export EXA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8812              EXA_API_KEY=dummy
export MARGINALIA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8813       MARGINALIA_API_KEY=dummy
```

The proxy must drop the client's auth header and add the real one: `Authorization: Bearer` (Kagi), `x-api-key` (Exa), `API-Key` (Marginalia). The ledgers and quota lines work unchanged.

Without a Marginalia key, the scripts use Marginalia's shared `public` key. That's enough to try things out, but it runs out quickly. Kagi and Exa have no fallback. If you skip one of them, leave it out of the fan-out: `meta-search.sh -e marginalia,exa "query"`.

## Check the setup

```bash
skills/web-research/scripts/doctor.sh          # offline: tools, keys, optional extras
skills/web-research/scripts/doctor.sh --live   # plus one real query per engine (~$0.02 total)
```

With the Claude Code plugin, you can also just ask: *"run the web-research doctor script"*.

## Try it

```bash
cd skills/web-research
./scripts/meta-search.sh "static site generators for personal wikis"          # kagi + marginalia
./scripts/meta-search.sh -e all "essays arguing against infinite scroll"       # + exa
./scripts/fetch-page.sh https://example.com/some/article
./scripts/search-cost.sh
```

Or ask your agent something like *"research what practitioners say about X, find the best sources"*. The `web-research` skill tells it which engine to use and how.

## Handing this to your agent

If you'd rather have your agent set this up and adapt it, paste this:

> Install the skills from https://github.com/tomooshi/search-three for this harness (read its README). Then run `skills/web-research/scripts/doctor.sh` and walk me through anything marked ✗: API keys, missing tools. Don't put keys in the repo. Use `~/.config/<engine>/api_key` with chmod 600. If a script path doesn't resolve in this harness, fix it so the four skill folders stay side by side, and don't hardcode my home directory.

## Cost tracking

Every script call adds one JSON line to a local ledger:

```
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/kagi/usage.jsonl
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/exa/usage.jsonl
${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/marginalia/usage.jsonl
```

`search-cost.sh` summarizes spend for today, this month, and all time. The ledgers only count calls made through these scripts. Each provider's dashboard has the actual bill.

## Configuration

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `KAGI_API_KEY`, `EXA_API_KEY`, `MARGINALIA_API_KEY` | API keys (override the key files) |
| `KAGI_BASE_URL`, `EXA_BASE_URL`, `MARGINALIA_BASE_URL` | API endpoint, e.g. a local key proxy (defaults: `https://kagi.com/api/v1`, `https://api.exa.ai`, `https://api2.marginalia-search.com`) |
| `KAGI_LEDGER`, `EXA_LEDGER`, `MARGINALIA_LEDGER` | ledger path, or `off` |
| `KAGI_RATE_SEARCH`, `KAGI_RATE_EXTRACT` | Kagi prices used by the ledger (defaults: 0.012 / 0.004) |
| `MARGINALIA_QUOTA_LIMIT` | daily Marginalia quota (default 1000) |
| `FETCH_PYTHON` | Python for the bs4/playwright fetch steps (default `python3`) |
| `CAMOUFOX_PYTHON` | Python with camoufox (default `~/.venvs/camoufox/bin/python` if it exists) |
| `SEARCH_SKILLS_DIR` | where the four skill folders live, if they aren't siblings |

pi footer extension only: `KAGI_COST_WARN`/`_ALERT`, `EXA_COST_WARN`/`_ALERT`, `MARGINALIA_QUOTA_WARN`/`_ALERT`, `SEARCH_COST_SCOPE`.

## Notes

- API behavior noted in the SKILL.md files (response shapes, quirks, silently ignored parameters) was checked against the live APIs in Aug–Sep 2026. Some of it will drift. If a documented flag stops working, trust what the API returns.
- Marginalia results are CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 on non-commercial keys.
- `fetch-page.sh`'s browser steps are for reading public pages. Respect site terms.
